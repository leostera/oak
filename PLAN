Cmdliner by @dbuenzli

Add flags:

✅ --vverbosity and --debug
  To be able to show a lot more output and diagnose what's going on with it

✅ -help : to see how to use the tool

* --level N : to limit the listing to N levels

* --use-gitignore : should ignore stuff in .gitignore and .git folder

  If you pass it in, and there is no .gitignore: do we fail?

  If we find one, we should ignore:
    .git — done, we ignore everything in it
    .gitignore
    anything listed in .gitignore

❌ --color : to show different colors for different file types

✅ a path from where to start!

Completely sync and blocking.
